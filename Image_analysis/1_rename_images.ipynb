    "\n",
    "I wanted to preprocess them into .tif images before I rename them, so that it doesn't take tesseract as much time to go through them. I shot the images in raw (.CR2 for canon), so we can easily correct white balance after the fact. If anyone is doing this again, I would try turn the auto white balance off on the camera, so you hopefully don't have to correct for white balance. In the grape image processing guide here: https://github.com/underhillanna/GrapeImageAnalysis, they also corrected for white balance. I tested it out to make sure that correcting the white balance actually makes a difference and the black background looks a lot more consistent in the white-balanced photos, so I am going to do it with all the images.\n",

    "I'm going to use RawTherapee (https://rawtherapee.com/) to run through this and export as a 8 bit tif file quickly.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. In the \"File Browser\" tab of RawTherapee, open up the folder with all the .CR2 files.\n",
    "2. Go to the Editor tab. Double click on the first image (make sure the check mark in the left hand corner shows up) Click on the white balance tab (on the right side, the thrid option). \n",
    "3. Click White Balance to expand the menu. Select \"Method:Custom\".\n",
    "4. Select \"Pick\"\n",
    "5. Once the dropper comes up, click on the white label. This will automatically correct the white balance. This will save a .pp3 file to where that image is saved. Now we can use this to correct the white balance for all the images.\n",
    "6. Double click on the next image (again make sure that the check mark shows up)\n",
    "7. Under \"Processing Profiles\" select the folder. Select the .pp3 from the first image that you fixed.\n",
    "8. Right click on the image that you just edited. Go to \"Processing profile operations\" and select \"Copy\".\n",
    "9. Right click on the image again and click \"Select all\" (make sure all the squares are now highlighted.\n",
    "10. Right click again. Go to \"Processing profile operations\" and select \"paste\". It'll take a little bit to process if you have a lot of images. Mine froze and got the spinning ball of death for ~3 min and then was able to process everything. All together it took no more than 5 min. At this point I would go through and make sure all the images are the right direction and make sure the white balance didn't get weird on anything. If something is wrong, double click the image and fix whatever you want. It won't have any impact on the other images.\n",
    "11. Make sure you have all images selected. Right click again and use the \"Put to queue\" with the gears next to it. This will put the images in the processing queue. From there you can export as a 8 bit tif file to where ever you want. 16 bit tif files would need to be converted to 8 bit if you are going to use them in the other downstream processing I at least have planned.\n",
